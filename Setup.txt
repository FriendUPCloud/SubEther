Manual installation instructions
--------------------------------

Treeroot is an open source software system for social networking, spreading of
information and deployment of webapplications. It is built on top of ARENA CM, 
or, in the enterprise version, ARENA Enterprise. Because of this, the 
installation procedure involves installing ARENA CM/Enterprise first. This
guide presumes that you are going to use ARENA CM.

At this time, these instructions imply that you have an average experience with
Linux, MySQL, Apache2 and PHP. You will not need to do any programming, but you
will have to edit some config files to set everything up.
